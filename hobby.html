        <p class="hobbypara">All work and no play makes your life dull. So you need fun activities too. Hobbies are activities that are fun, entertaining and relaxing. Your hobby can be educative too. There are many kinds of hobbies. People pursue their hobbies with great passion and zest. Developing a hobby for your self will prove to be useful. Hobbies will help you use your leisure time gainfully. Your hobbies may be lifelong. You can pursue more than one hobby too.

            Music, dance, reading, story writing, sports, philately, painting and theatre may all be hobbies. Interestingly, one person’s profession may be another person’s hobby. For instance, one could be a professional flautist, but for another playing the flute could be a hobby. A hobby is a fun activity that is pursued during one’s leisure hours.

            <h1 style="padding-left: 780px;">Painting</h1>
            <p class="hobbypara">
                I love to paint. It is my hobby. I paint with water colours. I like to paint beautiful landscapes. When we go on 
                holidays to different places like hill stations, desert areas, river banks or the countryside, I always take my art 
                material with me. I like to sit and paint a scenery as I watch it. The painting then is very vivid and comes alive. 
                I find my hobby refreshing to me. I keep all my paintings carefully. I have participated in different art exhibitions 
                and painting competitions at school and at state level events, and won prizes too.</br>
                <q class="hobbypara1">Art is not what you see but what you make others see</q>
            </p>
            <p class="hobbypara">Many people have painting as a hobby. So do I. I have always been keen of painting ever since my childhood. My mother 
                used to say that even when I was a toddler, I used to take the pen from my father’s desk and then scribble randomly on 
                the floor and the walls of the house. As I started growing older, I took up painting classes and started developing a 
                great deal of interest in it. I always devoted a couple of hours in the evening to painting. My parents had bought me 
                a paint box and a palette, seeing how much I enjoyed painting.</p>

                    <h1>Music</h1>
                    <p class="musicdescription">Music has great qualities of healing a person emotionally and mentally. Music is a form of meditation. While 
                        composing or listening music ones tends to forget all his worries, sorrows and pains. But, in order to 
                        appreciate good music, we need to cultivate our musical taste. It can be cited that in the Dwapar Yug, the 
                        Gopis would get mesmerized with the music that flowed from Lord Krishna’s flute. They would surrender 
                        themselves to Him. Also, the research has proved that the plants which hear the Music grow at a faster rate 
                        in comparison to the others.</br>
                        <q class="musicpara1">Beethoven tells you what it’s like to be Beethoven and Mozart tells you what it’s like to be human. 
                            Bach tells you what it’s like to be the universe.</q>
                    </p> 
                    <h2 style="font-weight: 200;">Magical Powers of Music:</h2>
                    <p class="musicdescription">It has the power to cure diseases such as anxiety, depression, insomnia, etc. The power of Music can be testified
                         by the legends about Tansen of his bringing the rains by singing Raag Megh Malhar and lighting lamps by 
                         <cite>Raga Deepak</cite>. It also helps in improving the concentration and is thus of great help to the students.</p>
                         <p class="musicdescription">Music is the essence of life. Everything that has rhythm has music. Our breathing also has a rhythm. Thus, 
                             we can say that there is music in every human being or a living creature. Music has the ability to convey 
                             all sorts of emotions to people. Music is also a very powerful means to connect with God. We can conclude 
                             that Music is the purest form of worship of God and to connect with our soul.</p>

                      <p  class="gardendescription">For me, the garden is an important part of the house. From an early age, I have an interest in gardening. 
                          Garden is a place that gives relaxation to the mind and soul. Besides, <span>gardening</span> can be an interesting and 
                          productive hobby. Also, it teaches a person the value of patience, hard work, and love and affection. Because 
                          gardening takes a lot of effort in growing and maintaining. It also gives peace to the person who takes care
                           of it.</p>
                           <h2 style="font-weight: 200; padding-left: 780px;">Maintenance of a Garden:</h2>
                           <p  class="gardendescription1">Everyone thinks that planting trees and plants is an easy task and anyone with a trowel, lopper, and weeder can easily do it. But, only gardeners and the people who do gardening knows the effort and energy that gardening needs.
                            Besides, only water is not enough for plants they also need manure. Also, they need daily care in order to keep them healthy and fresh.</br>
                            Moreover, most of the plants are green which means they need proper sunlight. Many people hire professional gardeners for taking care of their garden but doing 
                            it on our own is more pleasurable. Also, it helps us to connect with the garden.</p>

                           companionship (I think the word 'marriage ' is overrated ). But if you are taking time to read this, 
                           I hope you take away something to chew on thoughtfully and pass it on to your children, family, friends or
